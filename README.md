> Use this library for commercial pruposes.

```Why are we leaking this?```

Dolo (also known as DoloDE or cydolo) is a disgusting pedophile from Germany that manipulated underage girls to send him nud# pictures for his tool access. He also ratted others with the old tools, admitted to jerking off to people, all was covered by a 'false-positive' lie.

```Why do we want you to use this library commercially?```

Dolo had a public library named msplib before PlanetAI. He took it down from NuGet because tool developers used it for making paid tools and he was getting mad about it.

## How to buiild:
- Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en/vs/) with [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- Install ```Newtonsoft.Json``` and ```protobuf``` packages from NuGet
- Enjoy!
